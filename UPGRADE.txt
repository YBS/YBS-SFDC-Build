This document will list the steps required to update the build process to a new
API version.

- Get the "current" version of the Force.com WSC project:
    git clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/wsc.git
    (May need to git checkout the specific version for the API version you are looking to build)

- Build Force.com WSC Project:
    mvn clean package -Dgpg.skip
    
- Download the correct versions of the following WSDLS:  Partner, Metadata, Tooling

- Build JAR files for each WSDL (replace 43 with correct API version):
    java -jar target/force-wsc-43.0.0-uber.jar <inputwsdlfile> <outputjarfile>

- Copy JAR files (force-wsc.jar, metadata.jar, partner.jar, tooling.jar) to 
    java/lib and sfdc/lib directories.
    
- Download the latest ant migration tool zip file and extract the files.  Copy the
    ant-salesforce.jar file to sfdc/lib directory.

- Download the latest Data Loader application and extract the dataloader-XX.jar file
    and copy it as sfdc/lib/DataLoader.jar.
