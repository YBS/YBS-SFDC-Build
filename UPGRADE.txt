UPGRADE.TXT

This document will list the steps required to update the build process to a new
API version.

- Get the "current" version of the Force.com WSC project:
    git clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/wsc.git
    (May need to git checkout the specific version for the API version you are looking to build)

- Build Force.com WSC Project:
    mvn clean package -Dgpg.skip
    
- Download the correct versions of the following WSDLS:  Partner, Metadata, Tooling

- Build JAR files for each WSDL (replace 43 with correct API version):
    java -jar target/force-wsc-43.0.0-uber.jar <inputwsdlfile> <outputjarfile>

- Copy JAR files (force-wsc.jar, metadata.jar, partner.jar, tooling.jar) to 
    java/lib and sfdc/lib directories.
    
- Download the latest ant migration tool zip file and extract the files.  Copy the
    ant-salesforce.jar file to sfdc/lib directory.

- Download the latest Data Loader application and use the following steps to generate a new 
    DataLoader.jar file for use with the build:
	MAC OS X:
        1. Create a new directory, such as DataLoader-37.0

        2. Show the package contents of the current Data Loader application and copy
        the Contents/Java directory (this directory contains nested directories that have
        all of the jar files that we want to combine) into the new folder contained in step #1.

        3. Go to the directory from step #1 in Terminal and create a jars folder:
        mkdir jars

        4. Copy the jar files from the java sub-directories into the jars folder:
        find java -name '*.jar' -exec cp {} ./jars/ \;

        5. Unzip the contents of the jar files into a tmp directory
        unzip -o 'jars/*.jar' -d tmp

        6. Remove MANIFEST.MF
        rm tmp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

        7. Generate combined DataLoader.jar file
        jar cvfM DataLoader.jar -C tmp/ .
		
	Windows:
		- Find the dataloader-XX.0.0-uber.jar file in the installed directory and copy it to the lib 
		directory and rename it DataLoader.jar.

- Update the java SalesforceTask.java file to set the API_VERSION and BUILD_VERSION to their new values.
        - Build the YBS-ant.jar file

- Update the ReleaseNotes.txt with the new build version notes.
