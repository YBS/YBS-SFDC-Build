YBS Build Release Notes
-----------------------

v37.1:
    - Included new "sf.includeManagedPackages" setting in salesforce.properties to
      control whether managed package components should be included (defaults to false).
      
    - Updated build to switch retrieve of some metadata components to use Tooling API
      instead of List Metadata calls.
    
    - Added log statements during createPackageXml to show progress and timings
    
    - Changed behavior of following types:
        - sf.includeLabels now using CustomLabel Metadata type instead of CustomLabels type
          which allows each label to be individually listed in package.xml.
    
v37.0:
    - Updated build lib files to use API Version 37.0 (Summer '16)
    
    - Added confirmation input for deploy and import.
    
    - Implemented documentObjectFields to create a CSV file with
      documentation related to an objects fields (type, description, created date,
      layouts, field trip, etc...).  Use following syntax to run:
        ant documentObjectFields -Dsf.objectApiName=Account
    
    - To upgrade a v35.1 build directory to v37.0, copy the following files to the
      build directory:
            build.xml
            lib/DataLoader.jar
            lib/YBS-ant.jar
            lib/ant-salesforce.jar
            lib/force-wsc.jar
            lib/metadata.jar
            lib/partner.jar
            lib/tooling.jar
            samplelogin.properties
            xsl/ProfileRecordTypeVisibilities.xsl
            xsl/StateCountryPicklistValues.xsl
      Then update the login.properties file to use API 37.0 and do an "ant install" to
      install the updated jar files.

v35.1:
	- Updated build to use latest version (35.X) of DataLoader.  The new DataLoader.jar conflicts
		with the other JAR files that are being copied to the ant.home/lib directory.  The
		DataLoader.jar file isn't actually needed in the ant.home/lib directory (it is always
		referenced from the project lib directory) so it has been excluded from the ant install
		target.  If you have a copy of DataLoader.jar (old or new) in ant.home/lib please manually
		delete it.
		
	- Updated all of the build files in preparation for initial public release.  Cleaned up several
		classes and the build.xml script.
	
	- Updated the YBS-ant.jar file to also connect using the Tooling API in preparation for future
		updates.  This required removing most of the WSC related classes from the ant-salesforce.jar
		file to prevent conflicts with current versions (which are now supplied in separate force-wsc.jar, 
		metadata.jar, partner.jar, and tooling.jar files).
	
	- If you have an existing project you will want to replace the following files/directories with
		the current versions that are under the sfdc directory:
			- build.xml
			- lib/ directory (remove all files and replace with current versions)
			- data/config/ directory (remove all files and replace with current versions) 
	
v35.0:
	- Updated build to use API version 35.0 (Winter '16)
	
	- Added the following meta-data include settings for salesforce.properties
		- sf.includeActionLinkGroupTemplates
		- sf.includeAuraDefinitionBundles  (i.e. Lightning Bundles)
		- sf.includeCustomPermissions
		- sf.includeMatchingRules
		- sf.includeNamedCredentials
		- sf.includeLeadConvertSettings
		- sf.includeNameSettings
		- sf.includePathAssistantSettings
		- sf.includePathAssistants
		- sf.includePlatformCachePartitions
		- sf.includeSharingRules (replaced old individual sharing rules removed)
		- sf.includeSynonymDictionary
	
	- Removed the following old meta-data include settings for salesforce.properties:
		- sf.includeAccountSharingRules
		- sf.includeCampaignSharingRules
		- sf.includeCaseSharingRules
		- sf.includeContactSharingRules
		- sf.includeCustomObjectSharingRules
		- sf.includeLeadSharingRules
		- sf.includeOpportunitySharingRules
		- sf.includeUserSharingRules
	
	- Added new sf.excludeUserPermissions property in salesforce.properties to allow a
		semi-colon (;) delimited list of userPermissions to remove from profiles.  We were
		using a hard-coded list in the code of permissions to remove but now this is 
		dynamic.  To keep the same functionality you would need to add the following to
		salesforce.properties:
		
			sf.excludeUserPermissions=EditBillingInfo;ManageUnlistedGroups;AllowUniversalSearch;ViewCaseInteraction
			
		You will probably want to add the new ManageSandboxes permission since it is only 
		available in Production environments and not in Sandboxes (which prevents a deploy).
		The suggested default value of this property is:
		
			sf.excludeUserPermissions=EditBillingInfo;ManageUnlistedGroups;AllowUniversalSearch;ViewCaseInteraction;ManageSandboxes
	
	- Updated the ignore logic to require the TypeName prepended to the element name in each
		ignore item.  The old format was:
		
			sf.ignore.XXX=Profile1;Profile2;Profile3
			
		But the new format must have the "TypeName." prepended to distinguish each
		Metadata Type:
		
			sf.ignore.XXX=Profile.Profile1;Profile.Profile2;Profile.Profile3
			
		The reason for this change is because there can be cases where two different
		Metadata elements may have the same fullName but can be different types.  If you
		ignored one of the fullNames you would ignore both of them.
		
	- Logic Updates:
		- Added missing logic for existing sf.includeChatterAnswersSettings property
		
		- Removed references to usernameSuffix logic which is no longer needed (it was
			used to fix usernames for prod/sandbox versions but that is now done by
			the retrieve/deploy tasks).
			
		- Removed the specialized logic for the Publisher Actions (QuickAction).  There
			was a bug in the meta data API that prevented the object name from coming back
			as the prefix in the fullName field for actions that are object-based.  For example,
			an action named 'NewChildCase' on the 'Case' object would come back with a 
			fullName of 'NewChildCase' instead of 'Case.NewChildCase'.  However, the value
			in package.xml would need to be 'Case.NewChildCase' for the retrieve to work.
			We had added a special 'sf.quickAction' property prefix to allow you to 
			specify the Publisher Actions you wanted to include instead of doing a listMetadata
			call to the get the full list.  This bug has now been fixed so we can use the
			listMetadata call and treat Publisher Actions just like other meta-data where
			we do a retrieve and get all them and then exclude any that are ignored.
